# Pikabot

A helper bot for [pokétwo](https://github.com/poketwo/poketwo) and some useful pokémon commands like:
- `find` - Can't remember the name of the pokémon you're looking for? Type what you remember and I'll try to find it
- `weak <type1 | pokemon>, [type2]` - See the weaknesses of a type or some pokémon
